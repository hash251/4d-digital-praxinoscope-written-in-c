Funny drawing app project

## Usage

Start Node.js server:
```
npm start
```

Start Rust drawing apps:
```
cargo run --release
```

Start drawing clients:
```
./sync.sh
```
## Architecture

Drawing Client:
- Rust drawing app written with `egui`/`eframe`, exporting images is done with reqwests for http requests alongside tiny-skia for the final drawing render.

Server:
- Create the server with Express
- Gets the images from clients with POST requests

Display Tablets:
- Communicate with websockets to receive the images
- Use a display which fetches the images from the main server and displays them on an Electron GUI.

## Some Notes

### Disabling Touch Gestures
Disabled using `gnome-extensions` (installed from a .zip)

```bash
~ Â» gnome-extensions enable disable-gestures-2021@verycrazydog.gmail.com
```

### Starting Apps on Login

There are two systemctl services which allow the computer to run the apps on startup. These are located in `/etc/systemd/system/npm-start.service` and `/etc/systemd/system/python-start.service`.

The `npm-start` services runs the `server.sh` bash script, which simply runs the backend server, while the `python-start` services starts the Python monitor mapping script in `start.py`.
